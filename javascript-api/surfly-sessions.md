# Surfly Sessions

The Javascript API provides a set of functions allowing you to start and control the behaviour of your Surfly sessions through the [SurflySession API](surflysession-api.md).

Once a session has been initialized, you'll be able to use several events in order to check the session status and, if necessary, make modifications depending on this status. More information on how to handle events can be found on the [session events](session-events.md) page.
