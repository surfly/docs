# REST API


By using the REST API, you can integrate our websharing technology into your own application or build a thin layer around our technology. You can completely customise Surfly and automate the management of client and agent creation through our REST API.

With our API you can do the following: 
Clients - Create new clients (reseller only)
Agents - Manage your agents
Sessions - Get an overview of all your session
Queue - Manipulate the incoming Queue for your agents

You can find the [REST API here](https://www.surfly.com/cobrowsing-api/)
