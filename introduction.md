# Introducing Surfly

### Welcome to Surfly

###### What is co-browsing?{#co-browsing}

[Surfly's co-browsing technology](introduction/the-technology.md) enables you to share your browser with others, synchronizing mouse clicks and key events. You may decide to video or text chat, share documents and highlight areas with the tool. You can start a Surfly session simply by entering the url of the website you want to browse into the 'start session' panel on your admin page. Then, invite people to join you by sharing the session url with them. This is the easiest and quickest way to co-browse and does not require any configuration.

However, if you wish to use Surfly as a feature on your own website, you can also add a Surfly button to your website. By doing this, you will be able to fully customize your session and use as much, or as little, of Surfly's functionality within your own product.


###### During the session{#during-session}

During the session, the mouse arrows from all users will be visible. Initially, the leader (i.e. the person who initiated the session) will be in control which means that they will be able to navigate the site, and the follower(s) can help guide them through it. In a Surfly session, there can only be one person in control at any given time, but you can have multiple followers. Moreover, control can be passed around between the different users during the session. The user in control can select or click items on the page, and if they decide to navigate to another url, the followers' screens will be synchronised so that they can also see this new page. The followers can take advantage of the drawing tool provided in order to highlight areas on the screen. During the session, users can also communicate via text or video chat, share documents and invite others to join them.

###### The Admin panel{#admin-panel}

Surfly's admin panel allows you to track your users and your agents, and can be customized to suit your needs.

The buttons on the admin panel are:

 - The 'start' button, this allows you to immediately start co-browsing.  When you click on this link you are asked to invite someone to join your session, by either sending them the session url directly, or via email.
 - The 'queue' button, which gives you a list of queued users.  You can add meta-data to this panel so that the agent knows more information about the user.
 - The 'history' button gives a brief overview of your session. You can also choose to record the chat logs which will then be accessible from the history panel.
 - The 'agent' button allows you to add agents to your account, and also gives you access to some information about agents such as their ID and the amount of sessions they have joined.
 - The 'settings' button lets you change your profile settings, and also includes your account details. Here, you can review your account plan, billing and personal information. The settings button also contains your integration information, the Surfly code snippet and the REST API key.
 - The 'log out' button lets you exit the admin panel.
