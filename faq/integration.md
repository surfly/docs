# Initial Setup

### Where can I find the code snippet?

The javascript snippet can be found when you login to your Surfly account. Click on the "settings" link on the menu bar to the left of the screen, and then select "Integration". You may have to click on "generate API keys", before the javascript snippet is shown. 
You will also have to add your websites domain name (e.g *example.com*) to  the "specify domain names" section just below the code snippet, then click on "setup widget". 

### Do I have to put the code snippet on every page?

Unless you want to use session continuation, you only need to put the code snippet on the pages you wish to start a session from. If you would like to use session continuation, the code snippet should be on every page you want to transfer cookies from. 
[see more about session continuation here](../widget_options/widget_options.md/#session_continuation)

### How do I take a call?

Login to your Surfly account and navigate to the "Queue panel". Click on the "take call" button next to the session request. You will enter a Surfly session with the user who initiated the request.
