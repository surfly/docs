# Integration guide


Our tutorial guides you through the steps we take as we integrate Surfly into our example application. We start by adding the widget code to our website, and make small adaptations to the code in order to customize the way the session behaves and appears. As we progress through the tutorial, we strip away Surfly's extra functionality, so that in our final application, Surfly acts as a transparent layer on our page. 

Major steps and changes are illustrated by an image/gif and, for each modification, you can refer to our [repository](https://github.com/MathildeJ/Cake_shop_example), where you'll find the corresponding commit. Here is a list of all the examples you can find in this guide:
