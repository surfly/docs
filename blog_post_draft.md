# Blog post draft

We're excited to present to you our new video tutorials, in which we will use our example application to guide you through the integration of Surfly's co-browsing technology. These videos work alongside the [integration guide](./the_surfly_tutorial.md), and can be used as a reference for further clarification.

### Overview of content

Starting with the basic setup, we will explore the various features and options Surfly has on offer. The first video shows you how to access the widget code, and add a support button to your website. At this point, you will be able to start co-browsing from your website. If you would prefer to customise the look and behaviour of the sessions, the following videos will demonstrate how to adapt the widget code to your needs. Finally, we demonstrate how to tightly integrate Surfly, so that it sits as a transparent layer on your website.

The following table of contents provides an overview of the video series:

### Welcome to our cake shop{#welcome}

The example application we have created is a cake shop, who pride themselves on high quality customer service. Surfly is perfect for them, as co-browsing allows you to share your browser in real time with others, synchronising your mouse clicks and key strokes. This ensures that the cake shop can continue to offer high quality customer service online, as co-browsing can dramatically improve communication between users.

### Add the snippet code{#snippet_code}

For the second edition in this video series, we will show you how to integrate Surfly into your website. We'll then demonstrate how a user can start a Surfly session and how agents can take calls to join a session that has been requested by a visitor to your website.

### Alter appearance of chatbox{#chatbox}

In this video, we will show you how to make some basic customisations, by setting options in the widget code we previously added to our example website.

### Field masking{#field}

We'll then use field masking to protect our customers' privacy during a Surfly session by hiding sensitive information from the agent.

### End of session popup url{#popup}

In this video, we'll ask our clients for feedback at the end of each session by displaying a survey as a popup.

### Create your own button{#button}

In this next part, we show you how to use your own custom button as a 'start session' button so that you can fully choose its appearance and behaviour.

### Integrate an existing chat solution{#chat}

We now demonstrate how to use Surfly alongside existing chat solutions. In this case, we chose to use Zopim.

### Session continuation{#continuation}

After this we'll make sure that, for each order placed from within a Surfly session, the information remains available even if the client exits the session.

### Blacklist option{#blacklist}

We'll then use the blacklist option to restrict access to a specific webpage which we don't want our clients to visit while they're in a Surfly session.

### Add metadata to the queue{#metadata}

Next, we'll provide more information to the agents answering calls so that they can greet our customers by name.

### Change appearance based on who is in control{#control}

We'll also prevent the agent from ordering without the client's consent by disabling the 'order' button if they are in control of the session.

### Remove the user interface (UI){#ui}

In this video, we'll take customisation a step further and remove Surfly's default user interface.

### The session ID approach{#approach}

Finally, we decided to make Surfly extremely discrete by using a small button to start a session. This button will also display the queue id when a session is started.

This is useful for cases when you would like to invite a user to start a session, rather then them starting one for themselves. An agent can already be in communication with them, for example via Zopim, and then be directed to the start session button. The user can give the ID to the agent, who will then be able to find the correct session from the admin panel.

### Conclusion

The final result is that Surfly sits completely invisibly within our website. We were able to fully choose the features we wanted to use, but also how we integrated them into our website.
