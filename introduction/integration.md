# Integration

<a name="add_surfly"></a>


If you integrate Surfly with your website, visitors will be able to click the 'get live help' button to request a session. They will then be queue'd until an agent (the person who receives the call) joins them. By default, the person who initiated the session is the leader and the agent who takes the call will be the follower, however you can choose to swap control at any time during the session.

To integrate Surfly, you need to add the Surfly code snippet into your website's source code. The default parameters within the code snippet can be modified to allow for a seamless integration into your website.  The code snippet will allow you to customise the way the session looks and behaves. You can specify your options in either the code snippet itself, or in the 'options' panel from the admin page. The options panel allows you to save your preferred options without adapting the widget code. If you do decide to change the widget code, this takes priority over the settings in the options panel.

#### The Surfly Code Snippet

This can be found by clicking on the 'integration' panel in your account settings.
If you get a message telling you that you do not have the API key set up yet, click on 'Generate API'.

You should now be looking at:

In the 'domain names' section on the integration page, you need to specify the domain of your website. For instance, if your website is hosted on "https://example.com", simply add "example.com" to the domain name list.

Finally, copy the code snippet and add it to the source code of your website.

When you open your webpage, you should see a 'get live help' button at the bottom left of your screen. If a visitor clicks on this, they will be queue'd for support. You can answer this request via the Surfly admin panel.
