<p>Yes! Just add a few lines of javascript to your website and you or your clients will be able to directly start Surfly sessions straight on your website. This is great for the support case where you can use our widget to show a support button on your website.</p>

<button class="section" target="section4" show="Can I control which parts of my website are visible?" hide="Can I control which parts of my website are visible?"></button>
<br>

<!--sec data-title="Can I control which parts of my website are visible?" data-id="section4" data-show=false ces-->

## Technology

<button class="section" target="section6" show="Which browsers are supported?" hide="Which browsers are supported?"></button>
<br>

<!--sec data-title="Which browsers are supported?" data-id="section6" data-show=false ces-->

<p>Cobrowsing with Surfly will work on all modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Internet Explorer 10+, Opera. It will also work on mobile Android devices using the Chrome browser and on Apple iOS devices Surfly supports Safari. Surfly’s videochat uses WebRTC and will run on Chrome, Firefox and Opera without the need to install any software. On other browsers a plugin can be installed the first time videochat is started.</p>

<button class="section" target="section7" show="Why is Surfly so fast?" hide="Why is Surfly so fast?"></button>
<br>

<!--sec data-title="Why is Surfly so fast?" data-id="section7" data-show=false ces-->

<p>We make use of an advanced content-rewriting proxy which allows us to send over the real HTML content from our high performance network. This is in contrast with for example a pure Javascript approach which relies on the upstream of all participants to send over the data.</p>

<button class="section" target="section8" show="How does Surfly differ from screensharing?" hide="How does Surfly differ from screensharing?"></button>
<br>

<!--sec data-title="How does Surfly differ from screensharing?" data-id="section8" data-show=false ces-->

<p>A few things differentiate us from screensharing:
1. We do not require any software to be installed
2. We send over the real content without any loss of quality
3. We can enable high performance video synchronization</p>

<p>That depends on your location. Non-EU: For all customers outside the European Union, we do not have to add VAT.

For private individuals or organisations without a valid VAT tax ID within the EU, we have to add your country’s local VAT percentage. The Netherlands: Surfly is based in the Netherlands so we have to add 21% VAT to customers (companies and individuals) based in the Netherlands.</p>
