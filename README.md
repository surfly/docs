#The Surfly Tutorial


###Welcome to Surfly

Surfly's co-browsing technology enables you to share your browser with others. To start a Surfly session, enter the url of your chosen webpage into the 'start session' panel on your admin page. You can invite people to join you by sharing the session url with them. This is the easiest and quickest way to co-browse and doesn't require any configuration.

Alternatively, if you wish to use Surfly as a feature on your own website, you can add the Surfly widget code to your website. Adding this code already allows you to start co-browsing, and Surfly works without any alterations. Small additions to the code allow you to fully customize the appearance and behavior of the Surfly session. You can choose to use as much, or as little, of Surfly's functionality within your own product.

documentation is divided into several parts:                     

##### The Introduction

The introduction explains what a co-browsing Surfly session is, and how it works. We outline the main features that Surfly offers, and the ways in which it can be adapted to suit your needs.

Major steps and changes are illustrated by an image/gif and, for each modification, you can refer to our repository, where you'll find a corresponding commit.


##### The Widget options

For quick reference, the widget options gives a list of the different changes you can make to either the code snippet, or the options panel in your Surfly account. If the options panel and the 
code snippet have conflicting settings, the setting in the code snippet has priority.
